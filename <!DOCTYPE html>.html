<h1>DR. MARTIN MAKUEK CHIMAN <p>(The excutive director)</p> </h1>
<h1> NOTE FROM EXCUTIVE DIRECTOR<p>"We are a volunteer team comprised of both medical and non-medical professionals who are on a mission of serving our vulnerable people. All of us grew up in hardship because of the wars and our supposed good childhood memories were stolen and replaced with war memories. In light of this, we are on a relentless quest for a better future for the vulnerable children and adults. In our mission to care for vulnerable children and adults, 
    our hearts beat with compassion. Every bit of support, no matter how small, holds immense value. Together, united, we can achieve far more than alone – our collective strength knows no bounds. I implore you to join in this journey, extend your hand, and help us reach out to even more vulnerable children. Your support is a beacon of hope, shaping a brighter future for those in need. Together, let's make a lasting impact, one that echoes through the lives of the most vulnerable among us. Your support enables us to extend our reach, touching the lives of more vulnerable children."<p></h1>
